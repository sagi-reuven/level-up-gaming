Level-up gaming
MERN stack project
online gaming store



# Important Note :
In the back-end there is a config folder which holds json web token key
Because this is a student project I uploaded it.
I wanted to give the full website experience and I know this is a bad practice under normal circumstances

# run commands (in terminal):

•	Cd {project directory} npm I {install node modules for each folder}

•	 Back-end {initial} npm run dev  (node)

•	Front-end {initial} npm start (react)

 # Description:
•	My first full-stack project using React JS and Node.JS with MongoDB 

•	CRUD (Crate – user, Read-user info, UPDATE – update user info, DELETE – delete user)  

•	Redux state management – connect the project to redux store reducer

•	Persistent cart using local storage ( saves users cart data in the local storage )
